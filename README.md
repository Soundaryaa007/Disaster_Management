# Disaster_Management
This repository is created for capstone project - (Disaster Management)

ABSTRACT:
The Emergency Management System is designed to optimize emergency response efficiency and streamline resource allocation during crisis situations. This platform harnesses cutting-edge web technologies, including Angular for the frontend, ASP.NET Core for the backend, and SQL Server for data management, all hosted on Azure cloud infrastructure.

Key features include a victim reporting interface by a responder, a rescuer dashboard for real-time data access, and a resource management module for emergency managers. Additionally, integrating a public API, such as reliefapi, will enhance location tracking and improve overall situational awareness.

By offering a robust and unified solution for disaster response coordination, this project aims to save lives and mitigate the impact of emergencies effectively
